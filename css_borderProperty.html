<br>
<h3>DASHED</h3>

Letâ€™s start with MongoDB,<br>the document database at the root of the MERN stack. </div>
<br>
<h3>DOUBLE</h3>
<div class="cls4">  MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database.<br> that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently.<br> It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables.<br>  </div>
<br>
<h3>INSET</h3>
<div class="cls5"> Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js.<br> You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the Node.js<br> that helps manage a server and routes. <br>It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. <br> </div>
<br>
