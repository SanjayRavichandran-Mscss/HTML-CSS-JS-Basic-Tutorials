<p class="mar1">  JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.

JavaScript helps the users to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface by the DOM API. It is mainly used in web applications.   </p>
